# Data Visualization of World Population

**Visualizing Distribution with Bar Chart or Histogram**

This visualization illustrates the distribution of a variable within a population using either a bar chart for categorical data or a histogram for continuous data.

**Instructions:**

1-Data Preparation: Ensure the dataset includes the variable to be visualized.

2-Running the Script:

Install necessary Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn).

Modify the script to specify the dataset and variable.

Run the script to generate the visualization.

3-Interpreting the Chart:

For a bar chart: Each bar represents a category, showing the count or proportion for each category.

For a histogram: Bars represent ranges or bins of the continuous variable, showcasing the frequency of values falling within each range.

**Dependencies:**

Python 3.x

Matplotlib

Seaborn 

**Usage:**

1-Clone or download the repository.

2-Download the dataset from Kaggle

3-Modify the script to point to your dataset and variable of interest.

4-Run the script.

5-Analyze the generated chart to understand the distribution
